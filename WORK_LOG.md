Obviously this wouldn't be effective for many changing 1s and 0s, but for this type of data it should work. I will also use "shorts" to make them even smaller. Even if its not enough room I can always use multiple |

That way I can skip some extra metadata. I also decided to read in the entire string before cutting up, that way I dont have to deal with out of bounds. I finished writing the compress function by just using some basic if statements that find the number and write them out. |
| November 22 |            10-11:05pm             | I also wrote my expand function. It was pretty straight forward as there seems to be no odge cases in my strategy (except if a sequence goes beyond the length of a short). After that, I just had to do lots of debugging bc I realized my compress function was reading the 1s and 0s as characters of 8 bits, not 1 individual bit. To do this, I had to change my approach a little bit by using a while loop, but most of my code stayed the same. Once I made this change, the result no longer differed for the first test case. I tried with the other test cases and they all worked too! Lastly, I checked the compression ratio for the files. Unfortunately, the first case actually made it bigger! The medium one was a little smaller, and the mystery one was a lot smaller. Now I think I will try to use data that is smaller than a short in order to make the compression better.  |
